## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code formatting
- Keep functions small and focused

### JavaScript Style Guide

```javascript
// Good: Clear and descriptive
function formatTime(seconds) {
    const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
    const remainingSeconds = seconds % 60;
    return `${minutes}:${remainingSeconds.padStart(2, '0')}`;
}

// Good: Comments for complex logic
function shufflePlaylist(tracks) {
    // Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
    for (let i = tracks.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [tracks[i], tracks[j]] = [tracks[j], tracks[i]];
    }
    return tracks;
}

// Good: Error handling
async function loadAudio(url) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        return await response.blob();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load audio:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, simple language
- Include code examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Add links to relevant resources

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add volume fade effect to player controls"
git commit -m "Fix progress bar not updating on Safari"
git commit -m "Update API reference with new methods"

# Not ideal
git commit -m "Update code"
git commit -m "Fix bug"
git commit -m "Changes"
```

Follow this format:
- **First line**: Brief summary (50 characters or less)
- **Body** (optional): Detailed explanation
- **Footer** (optional): Reference issues

Example:
```
Add keyboard shortcuts for player control

- Space: play/pause
- Arrow keys: seek forward/backward
- M: mute/unmute

Closes #123
```
