## How to Use Examples

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemantkush0/mix-player.git
   cd mix-player/examples
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   - Simply open the HTML files in your browser
   - Or use a local server for better experience:
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Explore the code**
   - Read the comments in each file
   - Modify and experiment
   - Learn by doing!

## Example Structure

Each example follows this structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Styles inline for easy understanding -->
    <style>
        /* CSS here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- HTML structure -->
    
    <script>
        // JavaScript code with comments explaining concepts
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Won't Play
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure audio files are accessible
- Try different audio formats
- Remember: autoplay requires user interaction

### CORS Errors
- Use local audio files
- Or serve from a local web server
- Ensure server has proper CORS headers

### Performance Issues
- Check browser compatibility
- Reduce visualization complexity
- Use appropriate audio bitrates

## Next Steps
