# Audio Files Directory

Place your audio files (MP3, WAV, OGG) in this directory.

## Expected Files

The default player configuration expects the following files:
- `sample1.mp3`
- `sample2.mp3`
- `sample3.mp3`

You can update the playlist in `script.js` to use different filenames.

## Note

Audio files are not included in the repository due to file size and licensing considerations. Please add your own audio files for testing.
